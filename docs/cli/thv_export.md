## thv export

Export a workload's run configuration to a file or OCI artifact

### Synopsis

Export a workload's run configuration to a file or OCI artifact for sharing or backup.

	The exported configuration can be used with 'thv run --from-config <path>' or
	'thv run --from-config <oci-reference>' to recreate the same workload with identical settings.

	When exporting to an OCI reference, the artifact is pushed to the remote registry.
	When exporting to a file path, the configuration is saved as a JSON file.

	Examples:
	# Export a workload configuration to a file
	thv export my-server ./my-server-config.json

	# Export to a specific directory
	thv export github-mcp /tmp/configs/github-config.json

	# Export to an OCI artifact (pushes to registry)
	thv export my-server registry.example.com/configs/my-server:latest

```
thv export <workload name> <path|oci-reference> [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for export
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

      --debug   Enable debug mode
